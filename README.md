### GantryOS

The purpose of this project is to have a simple binary, `gantryos` which handles all the resources of your datacenter and allows you to spin up containers and virtual machines (and eventually unikernels) via an API or with a single click.

The project uses SDN and openvswitch to manage and segment the network and offers, logging, monitoring, high availability and orchestration out of the box. No need to install, monitor, maintain and upgrade several different technologies.  
Everything is one click or one API call away.

### Status

The project is a work in progress.  
It is a monumental project for a single developer !  
So: Help wanted !
